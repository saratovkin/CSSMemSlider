# CSS Slider

This application was also created as a task from Rolling Scopes School.

Main idea of this task was to create a slider without JS and libraries (CSS only).

There are several different ways to do this. I used "transform: translate" and hidden radio buttons.

Also, I thought it would be fun to style this page in Windows 95 style ðŸ˜„. The elements in the slider itself are local memes from our school.
